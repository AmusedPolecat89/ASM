# ASM Code of Conduct

We are committed to a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of
background or identity. Contributors, maintainers, and users agree to:

* Use welcoming and inclusive language.
* Respect differing viewpoints and experiences.
* Gracefully accept constructive criticism.
* Focus on what is best for the community.
* Show empathy towards other community members.

## Enforcement

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behaviour and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to
any behaviour they deem inappropriate.

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behaviour may be
reported by contacting the maintainers at `security@example.com`. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

Maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct may be permanently
removed from the project team.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 2.1.
